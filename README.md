## Introduction

The COVID-19 Cases Animation project visualizes the progression of COVID-19 cases using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It leverages data visualization libraries to create animations that illustrate the changes in COVID-19 case numbers dynamically.

This project is valuable for understanding the spread and trends of the pandemic, providing insights through animated plots and visual representations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Animated charts and graphs that show the progression of COVID-19 cases over time.
- **Customizable Data Sources**: Easily adaptable to use different datasets or regions.
- **Interactive Plots**: Enhanced visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.
- **Educational Resource**: Great for learning about data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.

## Demo

You can view the project in action by opening the Jupyter Notebook and running the cells. Below is a snapshot of the animated visualization:

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dumpsterdj/covid-cases-animation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd covid-cases-animation
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. **Open the Notebook**:
   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open `Covid Cases animation Final v1 (1).ipynb`.

## Usage

After opening the notebook in Jupyter, follow these steps:

1. **Run All Cells**: Execute all cells in the notebook to generate the animations and visualizations.
2. **View the Animation**: The animation will display inline in the notebook if supported, or be saved as a file for viewing.

### Example Commands in Notebook:

- **Data Loading**: The notebook loads COVID-19 case data from a specified source.
- **Data Processing**: Processes and prepares data for visualization.
- **Generating Animations**: Uses visualization libraries to create and display animations.

## Customization

To customize the project:

1. **Change Data Source**: Modify the data loading section to use different datasets or regions.
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/dataset.csv')
   ```

2. **Adjust Visualization Settings**: Modify plot settings such as colors, labels, or animation parameters in the respective cells.
   ```python
   plt.plot(x, y, color='blue') # Change 'blue' to your desired color
   ```

3. **Add Additional Analysis**: Extend the notebook with additional cells for further analysis or visualizations.
